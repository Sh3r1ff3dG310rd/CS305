In this scenario I work for a software engineering company: Global Rain, which is working with our client: Artemis Financial.  
At Global Rain, we seek to improve their software security as well as pointing out vulnerabilities their software might contain.  
In my opinion I thought I did the dependency checks quite well and had no trouble implementing that code in the pom.xml.  
Having insecure code and outdated software can lead to security breaches.  
The biggest part that I found challenging later in the course was the checksum verification.  
Having clear and concise code and updated software can increase the layers of security and I will implement those throughout my personal and professional life.  
The references I used was mainly a lot of articles pertaining on which best hash algorithm to implement as well as the national vulnerabilities database was a very useful tool throughout this course.  
I think that the dependency check portion, as well as the certificate generation portion would be great skills when seeking employment.
